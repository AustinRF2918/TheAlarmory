-> We have a ButtonComponent which composes a SectionComponent which composes a ControlPanelComponent
-> We have a CurrentTimeComponent, SelectedTimeComponent, DeltaTimeComponent

-> Controller must take the ControlPanelComponent, and all of the time components
   and compose them: Whenever a message is recieveed from ControlPanelComponent,
   we would change our underlying data for SelectedTimeComponent and DeltaTimeComponent.

-> Controller will continously tic and send update messages to all components.

-> Seperate Type-Checks into seperate module.

-> Make any modules that have to do with handling of messages to a __handle module,
   for example in all the time components. This will give us a single consistent 
   API that we can use for ALL components, simply messaging a payload.
	-> We should probably look into Ember.js source code to guarentee good 
	type checking across all variables.
